> ## LEVEL 2: MAGICAL CUNNING
> If all your Pact Magic spell slots are expended, you can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute, at the end of which you regain half of those spell slots (round up).  
> Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Implementation

- The spell restores a single Warlock Spell Slot. If over level 11, it will restore an additional spell slot.
- It can only be used out of combat.
- It can only be used if all the spell slots have been used.
- It can only be used once per long rest.
